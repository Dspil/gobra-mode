To install it, one must clone the repository:

#+END_SRC

Then, add the following lines in your init.el.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

  (use-package gobra-mode
    :ensure t)

* Usage

The verify command is by default bound to ~C-c C-v~ which verifies the file corresponding to the current buffer.
To additionally convert the current buffer to go code use command ~C-c C-g~. This verifies the current buffer and converts it to Go code which is opened in a new buffer.
